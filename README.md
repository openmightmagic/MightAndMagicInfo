# Might And Magic Info

This repo is intended to serve as a "Getting Started" guide for playing  Might and Magic 6, 7, and 8 in the 21st Century. As such, it is intended to be a all-in-one guide for installing and using the many mods and engine reimplementations that now exist for the game (HD graphics, new game content, cross-platform support).

## Motivation

I've personally found it confusing and difficult to keep track of the many mods that now exist for the games (as of 2018). I wanted to create a simple self-contained guide for how to download, install, and configure them, so anyone can quickly get started playing the games.

## Might and Magic Engine Reimplementations

Same game content, new rendering engines - [See Reimplementations Page](/Reimplementations.md)
